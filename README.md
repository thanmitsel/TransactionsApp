# TransactionsApp
Python application for monitoring and analysing types of transactions with Bokeh library.

Requirements:
* Python 3.7
* bokeh 1.3.4

To run the application on localhost navigate to the directory that contains the bokeh_app and run:
> bokeh serve --show bokeh_app/

I have developed this app based on [WillKoehrsen](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/Bokeh-Python-Visualization "Github Profile") tutorials.
